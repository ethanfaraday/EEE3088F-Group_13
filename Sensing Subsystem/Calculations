Calculations

BPW34:

Reverse Voltage: Max: 60V (will never reach)


TSAL4400:

Forward Voltage: Typ: 1.35V; Max: 1.6V
Forward Current: Recommend: 100mA; Max: 200mA

2N3904

Desired Ic = 100mA (to run TSAL4400 at recommended current)
Gain: For Ic = 100mA, Gain = 150
Ib = Ic/Gain = 100mA/150=0.67mA
Rb = (3.3-0.9)/0.67mA=3.6k =3.9K
-> Ic=92mA
-> Rc= 20 =22
